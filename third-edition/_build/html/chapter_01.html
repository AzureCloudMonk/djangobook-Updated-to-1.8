<h1>Chapter 1: Getting Started<a class="headerlink" href="#chapter-1-getting-started" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>There are two very important things you need to do to get started with Django:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Install Django (obviously); and</li>
<li>Get a good understanding of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first, installing Django, is really simple and detailed in the first part of
this chapter.</p>
<p>The second is just as important, especially if you are a new programmer or
coming from using a programming language that does not clearly separate the data
behind your website from the way it is displayed.</p>
<p>Django&#8217;s entire philosophy is based on <em>loose coupling</em>, which is the underlying
philosophy of MVC. We will be discussing loose coupling and MVC in much more
detail as we go along, but if you don&#8217;t know much about MVC, then you best not
skip the second half of this chapter, because understanding MVC will make
understanding Django <em>so</em> much easier.</p>
<div class="section" id="installing-django">
<h2>Installing Django<a class="headerlink" href="#installing-django" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Installing Django is a multi-step process, due to the multiple moving parts in
modern Web development environments. In this chapter, we&#8217;ll walk you through
how to install the framework and its few dependencies.</p>
<p>Because Django is &#8220;just&#8221; Python code, it runs anywhere Python does &#8211; including
on some cell phones! But this chapter just covers the common scenarios for
Django installations. This chapter assumes you&#8217;re installing Django on a
desktop/laptop machine and will be using the development server and SQLite to
run all the example code in this book.</p>
<p>This is by far the easiest, and best way to setup Django when you are first
starting out. If you do want to go to a more advanced installation of Django,
your options are covered in Chapter 13: Deploying Django, Chapter 22: Complete
Installation Guide and Chapter 22: Advanced Database Management.</p>
<div class="section" id="installing-python">
<h3>Installing Python<a class="headerlink" href="#installing-python" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Django itself is written purely in Python, so the first step in installing the
framework is to make sure you have Python installed.</p>
<div class="section" id="python-versions">
<h4>Python Versions<a class="headerlink" href="#python-versions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Django version 1.8 LTS works with Python version 2.7, 3.3 and 3.4. For each
version of Python, only the latest micro release (A.B.C) is supported.</p>
<div class="admonition-which-python-version-should-i-use admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">Which Python version should I use?</p>
<p>Django 1.8 LTS works with the latest releases of both Python 2 and Python 3.</p>
<p>If you are just trialling Django, it does not really matter - either will
work as well as the other.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: All of the code samples in this book are written in Python 3</strong></p>
<p>If, however, you are planning on eventually deploying code to a live
website, Python 3 should be your first choice. The Python wiki puts the
reason behind this very succintly:</p>
<p><em>Short version: Python 2.x is legacy, Python 3.x is the present and future
of the language</em></p>
<p class="last">Unless you have a very good reason to use Python 2 (e.g. legacy
libraries), Python 3 is the way to go.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="installation">
<h4>Installation<a class="headerlink" href="#installation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>If you&#8217;re on Linux or Mac OS X, you probably have Python already installed.
Type <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python</span></code> at a command prompt (or in Applications/Utilities/Terminal, in
OS X). If you see something like this, then Python is installed:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>Python 2.7.5 (default, June 27 2015, 13:20:20)
[GCC x.x.x] on xxx
Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Otherwise, you&#8217;ll need to download and install Python. It&#8217;s fast and easy, and
detailed instructions are available at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/download/">http://www.python.org/download/</a></p>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: You can see that, in the above example, Python interactive mode is
running Python 2.7. This is a trap for inexperienced users. On Linux and
Mac OS X machines, it is common for both Python 2 and Python 3 to be
installed. If your system is like this, you need to type <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python3</span></code> in
front of all your commands, rather than <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python</span></code> to run Django with Python 3.</p>

<div class="section" id="id1">
<h3>Installing Django<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>At any given time, two distinct versions of Django are available to you: the
latest official release and the bleeding-edge development version. The version you
decide to install depends on your priorities. Do you want a stable and tested
version of Django, or do you want a version containing the latest features,
perhaps so you can contribute to Django itself, at the expense of stability?</p>
<p>This book only deals with installing an official release of Django (in this
case Django 1.8 LTS). Instructions on installing the development version can
be found in Chapter 22. It is recommended that you stick
with the latest official release, however it&#8217;s important to know the
development version exists as it is often mentioned in the Django
documentation and by members of the community.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve got two easy options to install Django:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Install a version of Django provided by your operating system distribution.</li>
<li>Install an official release from the Django Project website.</li>
</ol>
<div class="admonition-always-refer-to-the-documentation-that-corresponds-to-the-version-of-django-you-re-using admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">Always refer to the documentation that corresponds to the
version of Django you&#8217;re using!</p>
<p class="last">Keep an eye out for parts of the documentation marked <strong>new in development version</strong>.
That phrase flags features that are only available in development versions of Django, and
they likely won&#8217;t work with an official release.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="installing-os-distribution-version">
<h4>Installing OS Distribution Version<a class="headerlink" href="#installing-os-distribution-version" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Many third-party distributors are now providing versions of Django integrated
with their package-management systems. These can make installation and upgrading
much easier for users of Django since the integration includes the ability to
automatically install dependencies (like database adapters) that Django
requires.</p>
<p>Typically, these packages are based on the latest stable release of Django, so
if you want to use the development version of Django you&#8217;ll need to follow the
instructions for installing the development version from Django&#8217;s Git repository.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re using Linux or a Unix installation, such as OpenSolaris,
check with your distributor to see if they already package Django. If
you&#8217;re using a Linux distro and don&#8217;t know how to find out if a package
is available, then now is a good time to learn.  The Django Wiki contains
a list of <a class="reference external" href="https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/Distributions">Third Party Distributions</a> to help you out.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="installing-an-official-release">
<h4>Installing an Official Release<a class="headerlink" href="#installing-an-official-release" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The recommended way to install Django is with <cite>pip</cite>. Using <cite>pip</cite> to install
Django is an easy two step process:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Install <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pip-installer.org/">pip</a>. The easiest is to use the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html#install-pip">standalone pip installer</a>. If your
distribution already has <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pip</span></code> installed, you might need to update it if
it&#8217;s outdated. (If it&#8217;s outdated, you&#8217;ll know because installation won&#8217;t
work.)</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re using Linux, Mac OS X or some other flavor of Unix, enter the
command <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sudo</span> <span class="pre">pip</span> <span class="pre">install</span> <span class="pre">Django</span></code> at the shell prompt. If you&#8217;re using
Windows, start a command shell with administrator privileges and run
the command <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pip</span> <span class="pre">install</span> <span class="pre">Django</span></code>. This will install Django in your Python
installation&#8217;s <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">site-packages</span></code> directory.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are other ways to install Django that are not covered here. If you have
previously experimented with Django without using <cite>pip</cite> you will also need to
uninstall any old versions of Django. For more information, see the Complete
Installation Guide in Chapter 22.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="testing-the-django-installation">
<h4>Testing the Django installation<a class="headerlink" href="#testing-the-django-installation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>For some post-installation positive feedback, take a moment to test whether the
installation worked. In a command shell, change into your home directory and start the
Python interactive interpreter by typing <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python</span></code> (or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python3</span></code> if your
system has two versions of Python installed). If the installation was
successful, you should be able to import the module <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">django</span></code>:</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> You may have another version of Django installed.</p>
<div class="admonition-interactive-interpreter-examples admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">Interactive Interpreter Examples</p>
<p>The Python interactive interpreter is a command-line program that lets you
write a Python program interactively. To start it, run the command
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python3</span></code> at the command line.</p>
<p>Throughout this book, we feature example Python interactive interpreter
sessions. You can recognize these examples by the triple
greater-than signs (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span></code>), which designate the interpreter&#8217;s prompt. If
you&#8217;re copying examples from this book, don&#8217;t copy those greater-than signs.</p>
<p>Multiline statements in the interactive interpreter are padded with three
dots (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">...</span></code>). For example:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="k">print</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;&quot;&quot;This is a</span>

<span class="go">hello</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p class="last">Those three dots at the start of the additional lines are inserted by the
Python shell &#8211; don&#8217;t type them in. They are included to be faithful to
the actual output of the interpreter. If you copy any examples from
this book while following along, don&#8217;t copy those dots.</p>

<h3>Setting Up a Database<a class="headerlink" href="#setting-up-a-database" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This step is not necessary in order to complete any of the examples in this
book. Django comes with SQLite installed by default. SQLite requires no

Chapter 23: Advanced Database Management</p>

<div class="section" id="starting-a-project">
<h3>Starting a Project<a class="headerlink" href="#starting-a-project" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve installed Python, Django and (optionally) your database
server/library, you can take the first step in developing a Django application
by creating a <em>project</em>.</p>
<p>A project is a collection of settings for an instance of Django, including
database configuration, Django-specific options and application-specific
settings.</p>
<p>If this is your first time using Django, you&#8217;ll have to take care of some
initial setup. Namely, you&#8217;ll need to auto-generate some code that establishes a
Django <cite>project</cite> &#8211; a collection of settings for an instance of Django,
including database configuration, Django-specific options and
application-specific settings.</p>
<p>From the command line, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cd</span></code> into a directory where you&#8217;d like to store your
code, then run the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>django-admin startproject mysite
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This will create a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mysite</span></code> directory in your current directory.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">You&#8217;ll need to avoid naming projects after built-in Python or Django
components. In particular, this means you should avoid using names like
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">django</span></code> (which will conflict with Django itself) or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">test</span></code> (which
conflicts with a built-in Python package).</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition-where-should-this-code-live admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">Where should this code live?</p>
<p>If your background is in plain old PHP (with no use of modern frameworks),
you&#8217;re probably used to putting code under the Web server&#8217;s document root
(in a place such as <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/var/www</span></code>). With Django, you don&#8217;t do that. It&#8217;s
not a good idea to put any of this Python code within your Web server&#8217;s
document root, because it risks the possibility that people may be able
to view your code over the Web. That&#8217;s not good for security.</p>
<p>Put your code in some directory <strong>outside</strong> of the document root, such as
<cite>/home/mycode</cite>.</p>
<blockquote class="last">

matter right now, but it is important that you remember this when you go to

        wsgi.py
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>These files are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The outer <cite>mysite/</cite> root directory is just a container for your
project. Its name doesn&#8217;t matter to Django; you can rename it to anything
you like.</li>
<li><cite>manage.py</cite>: A command-line utility that lets you interact with this
Django project in various ways. You can read all the details about
<cite>manage.py</cite> in Appendix F.</li>
<li>The inner <cite>mysite/</cite> directory is the actual Python package for your
project. Its name is the Python package name you&#8217;ll need to use to import
anything inside it (e.g. <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mysite.urls</span></code>).</li>
<li><cite>mysite/__init__.py</cite>: An empty file that tells Python that this
directory should be considered a Python package. (Read <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/tutorial/modules.html#packages">more about
packages</a> in the official Python docs if you&#8217;re a Python beginner.)</li>
<li><cite>mysite/settings.py</cite>: Settings/configuration for this Django
project. Appendix D will tell you all about how settings
work.</li>
<li><cite>mysite/urls.py</cite>: The URL declarations for this Django project; a
&#8220;table of contents&#8221; of your Django-powered site. You can read more about
URLs in Chapters 2 and 7.</li>
<li><cite>mysite/wsgi.py</cite>: An entry-point for WSGI-compatible web servers to

</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="database-setup">
<h3>Database setup<a class="headerlink" href="#database-setup" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Now, edit <cite>mysite/settings.py</cite>. It&#8217;s a normal Python module with
module-level variables representing Django settings.</p>
<p>By default, the configuration uses SQLite. If you&#8217;re new to databases, or
you&#8217;re just interested in trying Django, this is the easiest choice. SQLite is
included in Python, so you won&#8217;t need to install anything else to support your
database. All the examples in this books assume that you are running SQLite.</p>
<p>If you wish to use another database, check out Chapter 23: Advanced Database
Management.</p>
<p>While you&#8217;re editing <cite>mysite/settings.py</cite>, set <cite>TIME_ZONE</cite> to
your time zone.</p>
<p>Also, note the <cite>INSTALLED_APPS</cite> setting at the top of the file. That
holds the names of all Django applications that are activated in this Django
instance. Apps can be used in multiple projects, and you can package and
distribute them for use by others in their projects.</p>
<p>By default, <cite>INSTALLED_APPS</cite> contains the following apps, all of which
come with Django:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><cite>django.contrib.admin</cite> &#8211; The admin site.</li>
<li><cite>django.contrib.auth</cite> &#8211; An authentication system.</li>
<li><cite>django.contrib.contenttypes</cite> &#8211; A framework for content types.</li>
<li><cite>django.contrib.sessions</cite> &#8211; A session framework.</li>
<li><cite>django.contrib.messages</cite> &#8211; A messaging framework.</li>
<li><cite>django.contrib.staticfiles</cite> &#8211; A framework for managing
static files.</li>
</ul>
<p>These applications are included by default as a convenience for the common case.</p>
<p>Some of these applications makes use of at least one database table, though,
so we need to create the tables in the database before we can use them. To do
that, run the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>python manage.py migrate
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The <cite>migrate</cite> command looks at the <cite>INSTALLED_APPS</cite> setting
and creates any necessary database tables according to the database settings
in your <cite>mysite/settings.py</cite> file and the database migrations shipped
with the app (we&#8217;ll cover those later). You&#8217;ll see a message for each
migration it applies. If you&#8217;re interested, run the command-line client for your
database and type <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">\dt</span></code> (PostgreSQL), <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SHOW</span> <span class="pre">TABLES;</span></code> (MySQL), or
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.schema</span></code> (SQLite) to display the tables Django created.</p>
<div class="admonition-for-the-minimalists admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">For the minimalists</p>

<p>You&#8217;ve started the Django development server, a lightweight Web server written
purely in Python. We&#8217;ve included this with Django so you can develop things
rapidly, without having to deal with configuring a production server &#8211; such as
Apache &#8211; until you&#8217;re ready for production.</p>
<p>Now&#8217;s a good time to note: <strong>don&#8217;t</strong> use this server in anything resembling a
production environment. It&#8217;s intended only for use while developing. (We&#8217;re in
the business of making Web frameworks, not Web servers.)</p>
<p>Now that the server&#8217;s running, visit <a class="reference external" href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/">http://127.0.0.1:8000/</a> with your Web

effect. However, some actions like adding files don&#8217;t trigger a restart,
so you&#8217;ll have to restart the server in these cases.</p>

<h2>The Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern<a class="headerlink" href="#the-model-view-controller-mvc-design-pattern" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>MVC has been around as a concept for a long time, but has seen exponential
growth since the advent of the Internet because it is the best way to design
client-server applications. All of the best web frameworks are built around the
MVC concept. At the risk of starting a flame war, I contest that if you are not
using MVC to design web apps, you are doing it wrong.</p>
<p>As concept, the MVC design pattern is really simple to understand:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The <strong>model(M)</strong> is a model or representation of your data. It is
not the actual data, but an interface to the data. The model allows you to
pull data from your database without having to know the intricacies of the
underlying database. The model usually also provides an <em>abstraction</em> layer
with your database, so that you can use the same model with multiple databases.</li>
<li>The <strong>view(V)</strong> is what you see. It is the presentation layer for your model.
On your computer, the view is what you see in the browser for a Web app, or the UI
for a desktop app. The view also provides an interface to collect user input.</li>
<li>The <strong>controller(C)</strong> controls the flow of information between the model and
the view. It uses programmed logic to decide what information is pulled from
the database via the model and what information is passed to the view. It also
gets information from the user via the view and implements business logic:
either by changing the view, or modifying data through the model, or both.</li>
</ul>
<p>Where it gets difficult is the vastly different interpretation of what actually
happens at each layer - different frameworks implement the same functionality in
different ways. One might say a certain function belongs in a view, while an
other might vehemently defend the need for it to be in the controller.</p>
<p>You, as a budding programmer who Gets Stuff Done, do not have to care about this
because in the end, it <em>doesn&#8217;t matter</em>. As long as you understand how Django
implements the MVC pattern, you are free to move on and get some real work done.
Although, watching a flame war in a comment thread can be a highly amusing
distraction...</p>
<p>Django follows the MVC pattern closely, however it does implement it&#8217;s own logic
in the implementation. Because the &#8220;C&#8221; is handled by the framework itself and
most of the excitement in Django happens in models, templates and views, Django
is often referred to as an <em>MTV framework</em>. In the MTV development pattern,</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>M</em> stands for &#8220;Model,&#8221; the data access layer. This layer contains
anything and everything about the data: how to access it, how to validate
it, which behaviors it has, and the relationships between the data. We will be
looking closely at Django&#8217;s models in Chapter 4.</li>
<li><em>T</em> stands for &#8220;Template,&#8221; the presentation layer. This layer contains
presentation-related decisions: how something should be displayed on a
Web page or other type of document. We will explore Django&#8217;s templates in
Chapter 3.</li>
<li><em>V</em> stands for &#8220;View,&#8221; the business logic layer. This layer contains the
logic that access the model and defers to the appropriate template(s).
You can think of it as the bridge between models and templates. We will be
checking out Django&#8217;s views in the next chapter.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is probably the only unfortunate bit of naming in Django, because Django&#8217;s
view is more like the controller in MVC, and MVC&#8217;s view is actually a Template in
Django. It is a little confusing at first, but as a programmer getting a job
done, you really won&#8217;t care for long. It is only a problem for those of us who
have to teach it. Oh, and to the flamers of course.</p>

you&#8217;re ready to move on to Django views and learning the basics of serving Web pages with Django.</p>
