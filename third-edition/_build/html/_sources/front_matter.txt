First and foremost, I would like to thank the original authors of the Django
Book - Adrian Holovaty and Jacob Kaplan-Moss. They provided such a strong
foundation that it has really been a delight writing this new edition.

Equal first in the shout out has to be the Django community. Vibrant and
collaborative, the Django community is what really stood out to this cynical
old businessman 6 years ago when I first discovered the "new kid on the
web-framework block". It is the support of all of you that makes Django so
great.
