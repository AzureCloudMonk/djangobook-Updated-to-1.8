.. New Django Book v0.1 documentation master file, created by

   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Mastering Django!
============================

*Mastering Django: Core* is a completely revised and updated version of the Django
Book - first published by Apress in 2007 as *"The Definitive Guide to Django: Web
Development Done Right"* and then republished as *'The Django Book'* by the
original authors in 2009. The latter publication was released as an Open
Source project under the Gnu Free Documentation License (GFDL).

*Mastering Django: Core* could be considered an unofficial 3rd edition of the
Django Book, although I will leave it up to Jacob and the Django community to
decide whether it deserves that honor. Personally, I wanted to see it back
out there because, like many Django programmers, the Django Book is where I got
started.

At the moment, what you are looking at is a static Sphinx build. I plan on
moving the content to a proper website in the coming weeks. I will also be
adding a screencast to each chapter over time so you can follow the videos
along with the text.

My goal with the update is the same as the original Django Book -- to provide
a freely available, definitive resource that takes a budding Django programmer
from knowing nothing about Django, to being able to build well written, high
performance websites.

In many places, this book is the same as the Django documentation, mostly
because that's what the original Django Book was -- a more conversational,
linear version of the docs that took you through building a books app to help
you learn Django.

**What this project lacks at the moment is your input.**

For it to become a great resource, your feedback and suggestions
will assist greatly in improving clarity, readability and most important of
all, make it fun to use!

Here's where you can help:

* Sections that need additional explanation, screenshots or code for clarity
* Sections that are too wordy or heavy on theory and are hard to follow
* Typo's and grammar errors
* I could also do with an expert eye for the chapter on deployment as I am not
  experienced in scaling (have always left that to my host)

I am happy for anyone with constructive feedback to email me directly at
nigel@masteringdjango.com. The project is also hosted on Git_.

All the best, and I look forward to your feedback.
